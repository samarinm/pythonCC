## Set up Python

In order to set up Python on your own machine, I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Follow the steps outlined in my [YouTube instruction video](https://youtu.be/-RJnYbxVZTg) to install Python and getting started with the Jupyter notebooks.

If you are more advanced and/or Anaconda is already set up on your machine, you can create a new environment with the necessary libraries through

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
``` 

activate the environment via

```
conda activate pythonCC
``` 

and start Jupyter lab with

```
jupyter lab
```
