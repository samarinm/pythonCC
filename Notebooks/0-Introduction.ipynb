    "# Python Crash Course\n",
    "\n",
    "In this crash course we will see a lot of different concepts in Python. In the following notebooks, \n",
    "we will go through some of the most relevant aspects of Python that we considered you should know. \n",
    "This cannot be an exhaustive introduction, as each task might require some very specific \n",
    "tools. For this reason, there might be some objects or commands you later find useful but have not seen in this course. \n",
    "However, you only really become \"fluent\" in a programming language by trying to implement your own projects\n",
    "and learn from difficulties you encounter along the way. This course is intended to be a first step in that direction!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we cover __Python 3__ here. There exists a lot of code on the Internet (or in your group) \n",
    "written in earlier versions such as Python 2.7. Usually you can identify Python 2.7 code because you \n",
    "find print statements like \n",
    "\n",
    "```print \"This prints an output in Python 2\"``` \n",
